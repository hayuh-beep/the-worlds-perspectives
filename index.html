        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
         Cultural identity is the sense of belonging to a particular group and it is shaped by factors like ancestry, religion, and social class (Baskin, 2024). Understanding culture and how it is shaped is extremely important in an increasingly globalized world, as doing so helps in fostering empathy and maintaining respectful communication across borders and, most importantly, in breaking harmful stereotypes. The following paper analyzes the similarities and differences in cultures around the world, looking into how cultural traditions, values, and superstitions shape identity while also highlighting shared human experiences across borders.

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
         In order to gain a deeper understanding of cultural perspectives, I conducted 11 semi-structured interviews with participants being from France, Tunisia, Scotland, Netherlands, Brazil, Philippines, USA, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Pakistan. I asked primarily open-ended questions that were counted below by participants predominantly to compare how individuals from different cultural backgrounds answered the same questions. Interviews were selected as a primary research method, allowing for an in-depth exploration of the person's background, beliefs, and experiences.

        <h3>Cultural Identity and Family </h3>
        <p>
         Family is the main transmitter of culture. It passes down cultural traditions, languages, religious beliefs, and customs. Despite the differing degrees of the role of family within an individual society, it is nonetheless the main unit that shapes one's cultural identity. As children, we observe elders' behaviors and interactions and subconsciously absorb and present these values within ourselves.  Primary principles that were prevalent from the results of my interviews with the participants are the importance of kindness and respect. These two values are integrated into all cultures, even when family and community is diminishing in one's life. Ultimately, while the presentation of culture may differ over time, true values instilled by family continue to influence identity, behavior, and perspective long after childhood.

        <h3>Traditions and Customs </h3>
        <p>
         The traditions and customs grounded within a culture is to honor and celebrate their identity. This is observed through celebrations like Burns Night in Scotland and Foundation Day in Saudi Arabia. Traditions act as a bridge between the past and the present, encompassing the meaning of one's culture through things like dance, music, food, gatherings, and sports. Nonetheless all participants themselves realized the diversity within their own culture and highlighted the complexity that is present within their countries through regional differences or tribal differences. Ultimately, traditions are shaped under the principle of celebration of what unites a group of people and it cannot be subjected to reduction into stereotypes or a single narrative.

        <h3>Misunderstandings About Culture </h3>
        <p>
         Something prevalent to all members of the human race is the strive for dominance and control. This has led to war, occupation, exploitation, and slavery. This is the direct cause for stereotype formation. Stereotypes, both positive and negative, can restrict personal identity, limit opportunities, and reinforce societal biases. Participants spoke of stereotypes ranging from the Dutch being too liberal all the way to Filipinos being subjected to the service industry. The use of stereotypes is based solely for the reason of personal gain or dominance. Furthermore, the way stereotypes are used is based on one's personal morals. For instance, one might believe service-based professions are unprestigious or simplistic, while others might view them as honorable and essential contributions to society. These contrasting perspectives reveal that stereotypes are not objective truths, but are rather judgments shaped by cultural upbringing, social influence, and personal beliefs.

        <h3>Superstitions </h3>
        <p>
        Superstitions across all participants I spoke to are not a part of one's intrinsic behavior or in everyday life. Some do believe in and practice superstitions, however, in this day and age, it is no longer a part of daily life nor is it a factor in assessing the principles and formations of culture. Despite declining usage, superstitions remain in popular culture and entertainment, often practiced in situations of anxiety to boost confidence or maybe as a part of habit even if they don't consciously believe in it.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
         In conclusion, cultural identity is not formed alone; it is built through family traditions and community. Family serves as the foundational transmitter of culture, instilling principles like kindness and respect that stay with a person their whole life. Traditions honor history and celebrate what unites communities, while also embracing internal diversity. At the same time, stereotypes reveal how personal morals and social conditioning shape the way cultures and roles are perceived. Ultimately, culture is both inherited and interpreted; it is kept alive through shared practices, yet is shaped by the individual's understanding of this. This goes to show the complexity of culture, and therefore the importance of not subjecting a specific culture to the conformities of stereotypes, but rather fostering empathy and understanding whilst observing one's culture firsthand.
